# Coronavirus Group Project (The Bridge)

This project aims to report on coronavirus cases in five countries (Mexico, Netherlands, Brazil, Iran and Spain) since the beginning of the pandemic.

## Our data sources
- **Our World in Data (OWID):** OWID has a [dataset](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data) that is updated daily and provides data about not only confirmed cases, hospitalizations, vaccinations or deaths; but also other variables of potential interest.

The dataset is available in [JSON](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.json), [CSV](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv) and [XSLX](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.xlsx) formats.

OWID also made a [codebook](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/owid-covid-codebook.csv) available with a description of each source in the dataset.
